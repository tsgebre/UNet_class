# UNet_class
U-Net architecture in PyTorch.

Here, the DoubleConv module defines a sequence of two convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation. The UNet module then uses this DoubleConv module to define the U-Net architecture with the given number of input channels, output channels, and features.

The downs list in the __init__ method defines the down-sampling path of the U-Net, while the ups list defines the up-sampling path. The pool module is used for down-sampling.

The forward method implements the forward pass of the U-Net. The input x is passed through the down-sampling path, and the output of each DoubleConv module is stored in the skip_connections list. The bottleneck layer is then applied to the output of the last down-sampling layer.

Next, the up-sampling path is applied, where the output of each up-convolutional layer is concatenated with the corresponding skip connection from the down-sampling path. The final output is passed through a 1x1 convolutional layer to produce the output feature map with the same size as the input image.

Note that this implementation of the U-Net uses padding to preserve the spatial resolution of the feature maps during the downsampling and upsampling operations. The padding size is set to same, which means that the output size of the convolutional layers is the same as the input size. This ensures that the skip connections between the encoder and decoder have matching feature map sizes, which is crucial for combining the high-level and low-level features.
